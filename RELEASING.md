# Releasing ezu

Family versioning, tagging, and release policy:
[tenkai ADR 0040](https://github.com/Sannrox/tenkai/blob/main/docs/decisions/0040-family-versioning-and-release-policy.md).

This page is ezu-local: how a maintainer prepares and tags **this**
repository.

## Compatibility of configuration, CLI and JSON output

- **Configuration.** ezu reads no config file; it is configured by `EZU_*`
  environment variables. A variable is renamed or removed only after one
  minor release that still honours it and logs a deprecation warning naming
  its replacement. A setting's meaning never changes under the same name.
  Should ezu gain a config file, it carries a `version` and refuses unknown
  versions.
- **CLI.** The `diagnostics` subcommand, and any added later, follow the
  same rule: one minor of deprecation warning before removal.
- **JSON output.** The `diagnostics` bundle is an API: fields are only added
  in a minor; removing or renaming one is a breaking change listed under
  Breaking in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Who cuts a tag

Agents never push `v*` tags. After the version-bump pull request merges, the
maintainer creates an annotated, signed `vX.Y.Z` tag with the registered
release-signing key. The tag must equal the crate version in `Cargo.toml` at
the tagged commit. The workflow refuses unsigned or lightweight tags.

## Prepare

1. Choose the target version. Do not invent one in a feature pull request.
2. Draft notes with `scripts/changelog-draft.sh`. Pull requests never edit
   `CHANGELOG.md`; the release step writes the section from merged work.
3. Land the version-bump pull request. The crate version and CHANGELOG
   heading move together.

## Tag

Create an annotated, signed tag on the merged release commit on `main`:

```text
vX.Y.Z
```

A tag is never moved, deleted, or reused. The tagged commit must be on
`main`; the workflow refuses any other commit, so there are no hotfix tags
on `release/vX.Y` branches. A fix ships as the next patch version from
`main`.

## Release candidates

Cut `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` (or `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`) before the final tag:

1. Land a version-bump pull request that sets the crate version to
   `X.Y.Z-rc.N` and adds a `## [X.Y.Z-rc.N]` section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
   The final `vX.Y.Z` needs its own section; it never reuses the rc notes.
2. Tag `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` on that commit.
3. The release publishes as a GitHub pre-release and is never marked latest.

A failed release candidate costs only an rc number. A final tag on a commit
whose crate version is still `X.Y.Z-rc.N` is refused. Gate flags and
`scripts/changelog-draft.sh` count from the last final tag, so the final
release still covers the work merged before its release candidates.

## Start, retry, and dry-run

A `v*` tag push runs `.github/workflows/release-dispatch.yml`. It only runs
`gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=<tag>`, so the release always
runs **main's** `release.yml`, never the copy at the tagged commit.

`release.yml` refuses a tagged run that does not start from `main`. It then:

- checks out the tag and fetches the annotated tag object;
- verifies the signed tag with main's `scripts/verify-release-tag.sh` and
  main's allowed keys against the tagged commit's `Cargo.toml`;
- requires the tagged commit to be on `main`;
- runs the release scripts, tests, packaging, the static image and the
  manifest `git_sha` from that commit, and creates the release with
  `gh release create <tag> --verify-tag`;
- writes an SBOM, attests provenance, drafts the GitHub Release from the
  matching CHANGELOG section with a signed family release manifest
  (component, version, git SHA, binary and image digests, attestation URLs,
  gate flags), and publishes it last.

The release image is tagged with the version only. There is no `latest` tag.
Deploy the image by digest.

To retry a failed release, fix the workflow on `main` and run it again for the
same tag:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=vX.Y.Z
```

A retry picks up fixes to `release.yml` and to the tag verifier and keys
only. The release scripts, `CHANGELOG.md`, `Dockerfile` and the sources come
from the tagged commit, by design, so a bug there needs a new rc or patch
version.

A re-run resumes the draft release and replaces all of its assets. Every job
that attests, uploads or publishes refuses a release that is already
published, so neither a new run nor "Re-run failed jobs" on an old one can
change it; cut a new version instead. One run per tag executes at a time.

Pull requests and `workflow_dispatch` without a tag dry-run the same
packaging path on that ref. Dry runs never build the image, mint
attestations, or touch a GitHub Release.

## Provenance

Attestations record the workflow that built the artifacts, which is main's
`release.yml` at `refs/heads/main`, not the tag. The source is pinned by the
signed tag and by the manifest `git_sha`, which is the tagged commit.

Allowed tag-signing keys live in `security/release-tag-fingerprints` with the
public key in `security/release-tag-key.asc`. A tagged run uses the copies on
`main`.
